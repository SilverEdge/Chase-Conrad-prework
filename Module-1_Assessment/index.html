                <p>Hello! My name is Chase Conrad. I like to play soccer. My favorite color is orange, although I will admit that teal is the real deal!
                  Since I was young, I've enjoyed putting together websites for my friends and family. I have a degree in Economics from UW Madison.
                  Professionally, I have worked as a janitor, clerk, and data scientist. My favorite play is "King Lear" by William Shakespeare.
                  My dream is to code for a living!
                </p>

                <p>I have three brothers and enjoy playing ping pong, soccer, hacky sack and basketball with them.
                   I like to study financial markets, usually evaluating current conditions through the lense of options strategies.
                   One of my favorite strategies is to place a vertical long put on VXX after a spike in volatility.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If you are still reading this, then you must be pretty bored, so I will give you some more facts about me. I was born in Longmont, Colorado to LeAnn and Mickey Conrad.
                  At age 5, my family moved to Wisconsin where I have resided to this day. As a child my favorite hobby was building Lego sets.
